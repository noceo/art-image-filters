# Art Image Filters
I visited the Albertina art gallery of Vienna which featured a painting of Monet’s famous series The Waterlily Pond, as well as other impressionist and pointillist works of famous artists like Paul Signac, e.g. Venice, The Pink Cloud. 
I had the chance to explore different approaches to filter digital images taking a Computational Photography class during my Master’s. I implemented techniques so that the images appear in a style comparable to the way previously mentioned artists painted their works.
All filters are written in Python.
